# LiveHoldTimeTool <br>
A tool that shows how long a key is held for in ms. <br>

Usage: <br>
This tool is really just to be used when recording gameplay. The goal was to show holdtimes live, rather than rendering it after gameplay, so used simliarly to a keyoverlay. <br>
This tool includes a clickper/second counter too. <br>

Limitations: <br>
Its not perfect, for some reason when you double tap exactly, they are slightly off. I believe this is a limiation with python, which, I've lowered updating times since matching a keyboards 500 or 1000hz, would make any system cry in update times. The program uses opengl to note. <br>
Due to this, it should not be a exact representation or alternative to holdtimeanalyzer, since there is no end graph. <br>
It uses global hotkeys, so it does not work on replays. <br>
<br>
How to use: <br>
Simply chose the keys you want, and click ok. <br>
Resize how you want. <br>
